## Roadmap
The priorities associated with each area of development are in the process of being further defined as is the finite detail associated with each release to move PAR from its current version, 0.3 to a production version 1.0.

The roadmap breaks down into three distinct categories, each has one or more specific development areas:

1. Data model
2. Tools
3. Integration

### Data Model
The data model is the core component of PAR that describes the elements of preservation policies implemented using machine readable data structures. The data model describes attribute such as:
* Preservation actions that can be performed on digital content
* The tools that would be needed to perform the desired actions
* File formats
* Policy statements

The model has now matured sufficiently in terms of what can be done but further effort is needed to define what it could do and what itâ€™s limitations might be. So key focus areas for model development include:

**Project team to define**
**PAR Team Define**



### Tools
Development encompassess:

**Sync tool** that will enable preservation actions to be copied between systems??:
* PAR Project team - what else / what needs to be developed, what are the key features?

**Registry browser** this will replace the existing prototype, key functions will include:
* PAR Project team - what needs to be developed, what are the key features?

**Register editing tool** this will enable users to update their own registry??
* PAR Project team - what needs to be developed, what are the key features? 

**Client GUI tool**
* Function???
* PAR Project team - what needs to be developed, what are the key features? 

**Empty registry**
* Function???

PAR Team - Are there any other generic / specific area of development that should be included in this high level roadmap???

### Integration
Development encompassess:

**API extensions** Further planned enhancements include:
* identity management
* PAR Project team - what else?

**Trusted source integration**
* Wikidp
* Other trusted sources / end points as identified

**Vendor DP systems**
* Integration of other vendor DP systems
